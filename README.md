Instructions

A headless application is one that has all CRUD operations on a document.

1- Create a headless MEAN games application. For this section it is fine if your application only deals with games (no publisher and no reviews).

2- Add publisher to the above point. Make sure you do this in a separate application. Operations related to publisher should be in a separate controller.

3- Add reviews (array of reviews) to a game. Again, different application and a new controller for reviews.

4- Create a headless application for your SchoolDB database.
